# Camera Placement Application

Hi! Welcome to my submission for the Verkada Frontend Tech Challenge

I used `React` and `Three.js` to build an interactive, 3d simulation of the floorplan input

The user can fly around their given floorplan and visualize camera placements and the range they cover

Finally, the locations of all of their cameras are exported in JSON format
